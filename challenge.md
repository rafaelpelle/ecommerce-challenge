Implement the homepage using the framework of your choice (Angular, React, etc.) or even just HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Remember that the page must be responsive and adaptable to mobile devices.

Products must be dynamic and have their discount percentage calculated automatically. discount must be randomized on each page load.

The page must allow the inclusion of products in a cart, allowing the change of quantity or removal of the same. The products must remain in the cart even after the page reloads.

Don't forget that we are simulating a web page and therefore performance is very important.
